       Install libdEdx

Windows:

  (TODO)

Linux-like operating systems:

Configuration and installation is handled with CMAKE. 
Install cmake from your local linux distribition, or get it from http://www.cmake.org 

From source code:

   1) go to the directory where you have unpacked libdedx
   2) mkdir build
   3) cmake ..
   4) cmake --build . --target install -- -j2

which will build the .so or .dll file depending on the platform.
Additionally the example and auxilliary programs will be build, and the binary data tables will be generated.

Finally, as root, run:

   5) make install 
   6) ldconfig

this will copy the binary tables and tables to the relevant places on your system.

--- Python bindings --- 
Per default CMAKE will install the python bindings for you. It requires that you have installed the pyhton devlopment files first (python-dev). If it fails, you can still do so manually. Go to the python directory and consult the README file.
