Configuration and installation is handled with CMAKE.
Install cmake from your local linux distribution, or get it from http://www.cmake.org

From source code:

   1) go to the directory where you have unpacked libdedx
   3) cmake -S . -B build
   4) cmake --build build

which will build the .so or .dll file depending on the platform.
Additionally the example and auxiliary programs will be build, and the binary data tables will be generated.

Finally, as root, run:

   5) make install
   6) ldconfig

this will copy the binary tables and tables to the relevant places on your system.
