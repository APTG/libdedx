--- libdEdx TODO list ---

TBD = To Be Determined
TBC = To Be Confirmed

Not listed by priority.

* IMPORTANT: Override I-value for compounds 
* A clearer error message if MSTAR or similar is accessed with Braggs additivity rule but one or more of the constituent target/ion combinations are invalid.
* implement ESTAR.
* look into ATIMA, what it actually does. It is probably unrealistic to implement. In that case, calculate dEdx tables for all available compounds and ions Z = 1 to 18. 
* look into SRIM, what it actually does. It is probably unrealistic to implement. In that case, calculate dEdx tables for [TBD] compounds and ions Z = 1 to 18.
* Agreement between code and the inherited should be better than 0.1 promille [TBC]

* Test also if program could run using mingw (cross compiler for generating windoze exec/dlls)
* Nullsoft installer for windows
* Should be able to run on fancy ARM platform (ie. my HTC desire)
* GUI frontend

* implement CTEST framework
* RPM target
* Add man pages
