# libdedx

libdEdx is a physics library for stopping power calculations. 
Stopping power is the energy loss of a particle per unit length (dE/dx). 
libdedx is supposed to be both fast and easy to use, and features multiple standard dE/dx lists (ICRU, MSTAR...)

For the documentation see: https://aptg.github.io/libdedx/
